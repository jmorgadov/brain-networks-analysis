# Graph mining on brain networks analysis

This work shows how graph mining techniques, such as community detection,
can be used in classification tasks.

The goal is to classify subjects stimuli from brain activity encoded in temporal
graphs[^1]. The brain activity of each subject were recorded while they were
watching a movie or listening to a story.
